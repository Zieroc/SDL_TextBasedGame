        <SceneText>It seems you can't get lucky three times in a row. No other ships pass by and you spend the rest of your days stranded in space. At least the view is nice.</SceneText>

        <SceneText>You soon arrive back at earth and thank the martians for the lift. They beam you down right outside your house. Being stranded in space was enough excitment I guess as you decide to just go home and relax.</SceneText>

        <SceneText>You arrive on Mars. It is rather red. The martians said that humans were forbidden in there city and so dropped you in the middle of nowhere. Well at least you made it to another planet.</SceneText>

        <SceneText>You board the escape pod and launch yourself out of the ship. Unfortunately the pod seems to have little fuel and soon you are stuck floating through space. Stranded again but at least you have a pod this time!</SceneText>
